/* Documetation for the OpenGL Shader Program v0.1 written by Sruthik P.
   This program aims to display a 2D texture by loading it onto a sprite.
   The texture can be changed by the user via a GUI which will be implemented via Qt.
   */


CHANGELOG:

	-> Removed CEGUI and migrated to Qt.
	-> Added FPS Counter


PROJECT FILES:

	-> main.cpp - The entry point for the program.
	-> game.cpp - Contains the main game loop and initializtions for shaders and sprites.
	-> sprite.cpp - Contains the draw function for the sprite.
	-> GLSLProgram.cpp - Contains the Shader Compilation and Linking functions.
	-> ImageLoader.cpp - Contains the logic for uploading texture and Texture mapping
	-> IOManager.cpp - Contains a simple file parser
	-> Picopng.cpp - Code for decoding PNG images into memory
	-> ResourceManager.cpp - Used for Texture Caching.
        -> TextureCache.cpp - Texture Cache
	-> GUI.cpp - CEGUI Logic *not used anymore*
	-> errors.cpp - Global Error Handler

PROGRAM FLOW:

	The program starts with the main loop by initializing an object for the game class. Since SDL is being used the main loop's
	function parameters must be of the form "int main(int argc, char** argv)".fa
